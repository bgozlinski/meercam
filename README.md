# Smart Security Camera Project

## Description

This repository contains code and resources for building a smart security camera using OpenCV2. The project aims to create a security camera solution that is affordable, easy to set up, and reliable.

The project leverages OpenCV2, a popular open-source computer vision library, to capture and analyze video feed in real-time. Features include motion detection, object recognition, and video recording for post-event analysis. 

## Features to implement

- **Motion Detection:** Detects motion in the video frame and triggers an alert or starts recording when motion is detected.
- **Object Recognition:** Uses trained models to recognize common objects and potentially unwanted intruders (e.g. persons, vehicles).
- **Alert Mechanism:** Sends alerts via email or push notifications when specific events occur.
